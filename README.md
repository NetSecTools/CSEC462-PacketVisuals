# CSEC462-PacketVisuals
This project will focus on sniffing packets and utilizing them in a particular fashion. It will serve two purposes, customizing outputs of packets, and displaying Plotly Pie charts based off of requested information. Starting the program uses raw socket data and produces readable information in the terminal window. Once the capture is ended, the user can select from various Pie chart visuals to look at.
